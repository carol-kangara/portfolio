        I beleive programming is the ability to solve problems by coming up with physical solution and not just rough figures and approximations.Being a mathematician, i have faced many real life problems and I find modelling a better way to come up with equations that solves problems.I  came to understand that by programming I can get the solved equations to something physical.This is where my passion for programming begun back in 2017 and since then the passions got stronger until Moringa made my dreams come true.This scholarship means a lot to me  I have higher goals to achieve and I look forward to striving for them.
